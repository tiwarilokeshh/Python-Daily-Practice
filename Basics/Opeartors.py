1. You are given two integer variables x and y. You need to perform the following operations:

p = x + y : Addition
q = x - y : Subtraction
r = x * y :Multiplication
s = x / y : Division
t = x % y : Modulo

x=int(input())
y=int(input())
#code here
# Perform addition x+y below
p = x+y
# Perform subtraction x-y below
q = x-y
# Perform multiplication x*y below
r = x*y
# Perform integer divison x//y below
s = x//y
# Perform modulo operation x%y below
t = x%y
print(p, q, r, s, t)

2.Logical operators and, or, not are used in condition checking. Like a and b checks if both a and b are True. First a is checked then b is checked. a or b checks if either of a or b is True. If one is True; it doesn't check for the other. not a complements the boolean value of a.
Note: 0 and empty string are False and all other values are True.
In this question you basically need to do
a and b
a or b
not a

a=int(input())
b=int(input())
#code here
p = a and b
#Do a or b below
q = a or b 
#Do not a below
r = not a 
#The code below prints the output. Don't change it!
print(p,q,r)
